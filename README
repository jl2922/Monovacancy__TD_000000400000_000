VacancyFormationMigration Test Driver

SUMMARY
  
  This test driver calculates:
  1. Vacancy formation energy, 
  2. Vacancy migration energy,
  3. Vacancy relaxation volume,
  4. Elastic dipole tensor, 
  5. Defect strain tensor,
  6. Saddle point elastic dipole tensor,
  7. Saddle point defect strain tensor,
  at zero temperature and zero pressure.
  
  It works for all the elements, in either sc, fcc, bcc, diamond or hcp crystal structure.
  
METHOD
  
  The calculation consists of two steps:
  
  1. Calculate all the quantities corresponding to three different sizes of supercell.
  The Calculation of each size starts from constructing the periodic supercell, then take out one atom from the supercell.
  Then it does the relaxation of positions within the supercell to obtain vacancy formation energy.
  After that, it moves the nearest atom to the vacanted site and calculates vacancy migration energy with nudged elastic band method.
  
  2. Extrapolate from these three results to get the value corresponding to an infinitely large supercell.
  
  The extrapolation is based on the elastic theory, which gives the supercell effect on the quantities scale as A0 + A1/r^3.
  Therefore, we use the two larger size to fit f(x) = A0 + A1/r^3, and obtain a0, which we use as the source value.
  
  It also estimates the uncertainty, based on:
  a. Fitting with all the three sizes to the function above;
  b. Minimization criteria (fmax) used in positions relaxation and nudged elastic band calculation.
